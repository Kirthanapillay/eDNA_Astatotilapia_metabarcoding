# eDNA_Astatotilapia_metabarcoding
This is the directory in which the data and scripts associated with the study Dietary Differentiation Between Sympatric Ecotypes of Astatotilapia calliptera From Lake Masoko (Kisiba), Tanzania Revealed by Metabarcoding is located. We used dietary metabarcoding to uncover feeding preferences and identify presence of niche partitioning in _Astatotilapia calliptera_ Ecotypes. The raw data are available at NCBI SRA under BioProject PRJNA1145132. The raw reads were analysed as explained in Script_aquality_demultiplexing and DADA2.R. The results of the taxonomic assignment can be found in the Data folder, alongside other data needed for the statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted in R and are detailed in scripts 4-8.
